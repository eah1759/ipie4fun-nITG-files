# ipie4fun-nITG-files
The public repo for my NotITG mod files! (I'm still learning github and nITG modding so please be patient).

## Releases:
 - ### Mirin Template (1.0.0) - `mirin-template-what-am-i-doing`
   *Released: September 14<sup>th</sup>, 2022*\
   Obligatory "Learning how to make mod files" mod file using the template default song and chart.

 - ### Humanity (1.0.0) - `Literally My Cpomputer Graphics Final v2`
   *Released: September 14<sup>th</sup>, 2022*\
   The alternate song choice I had for making a mod chart to submit as my final project for my university computer graphics class. Half assed paper I stayed up all night the night before it was due and presentation slides created minutes before I had to present are also included for the shits and giggles. :)
