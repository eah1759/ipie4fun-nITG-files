## 1.0.0
#### September 14<sup>th</sup>, 2022 - Release!!
This mod file was originally created as my semester project for my university Computer Graphics class. You can still find the presentation file and final paper within this directory. Since finishing my Computer Graphics course, I have taken the time to fix the minor bugs in the file and polish what was there, but I did not add anything substantial since finishing the project. This file will also act as my first released mod file. I hope you enjoy, and more is sure to come... eventually.
